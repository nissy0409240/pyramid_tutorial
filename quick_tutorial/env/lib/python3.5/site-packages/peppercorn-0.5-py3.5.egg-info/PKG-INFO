Description: Peppercorn
        ==========
        
        A library for converting a token stream into a data structure comprised of
        sequences, mappings, and scalars, developed primarily for converting HTTP form
        post data into a richer data structure.  It runs on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and
        3.3.
        
        Please see http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/peppercorn/en/latest/
        for the documentation.
        
        See https://github.com/Pylons/peppercorn for in-development version.
        
        
        Changes
        =======
        
        0.5 (2014-09-29)
        ----------------
        
        - Switch to an iterative parser rather than a recursive parser to avoid
          DoS attacks.
        
        - Add the ``ignore`` operation. The subsequent data elements in the stream
          will be ignored until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker.  This feature
          is useful for form elements designed for client-side scripting, such as a
          "select all" checkbox in the middle of a list of other kinds of fields.
        
        - Add support for Python 3.3.
        
        - Drop support for Python 2.5 / Jython.
        
        0.4 (2012-02-14)
        ----------------
        
        - Peppercorn will no longer run under Python 2.4.  2.5 or better is required.
        
        - Python 3.2 compatibility.
        
        - Moved to GitHub.
        
        - Pylons project docs theme.
        
        - Added tox configuration.
        
        0.3 (2010-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - 0.2 was a brownbag release; a case was not handled where ``rename``
          operation types may not have children.  This release fixes that.
        
        0.2 (2010-09-02)
        ----------------
        
        - New operation type: ``rename``.  ``rename`` begins a special mode.
          The value of the first subsequent data element in the stream will be
          used within it's parent sequence or mapping; any remaining data
          elements until the corresponding ``__end__`` marker are ignored.
          This is mostly in support of radio buttons.  See the ``rename`` docs
          within `http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn
          <http://docs.repoze.org/peppercorn>`_ for more information.
        
        0.1 (2010-03-23)
        ----------------
        
        - Initial release.
